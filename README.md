## 📊 Management Reports (Admin)

The system includes a dedicated **Management Reports Interface**, aligned with the business requirements of the course.

The interface is designed to support the following reports:

* **Average occupancy of completed flights**
* **Revenue by aircraft size, manufacturer, and class**
* **Accumulated flight hours per employee (long vs. short flights)**
* **Purchase cancellation rate by month**
* **Monthly activity summary per aircraft**, including:

  * Number of performed flights
  * Number of cancelled flights
  * Utilization percentage (assumed 30 days/month)
  * Dominant origin–destination route

> 📎 Note:
> The interface is implemented as part of the **Information Systems Engineering** component.
> The full SQL queries, explanations, sample outputs, and visualizations are provided separately as part of the **Database Systems Design** submission.

## ⚙️ Business Rules & Edge Cases

The system explicitly enforces real-world airline business rules and operational constraints, including:

---

### **Role-based access & separation**
- Managers are automatically redirected from the public homepage to the admin dashboard.
- Managers are strictly prohibited from purchasing flight tickets, either as registered users or as guests.
- Managers cannot be assigned as flight crew:
  - Workers with a managerial role are excluded from pilot and flight-attendant selection lists.
  - Backend validation blocks assigning a manager to any crew role.
- Manager login prevents invalid role configurations where a single ID exists simultaneously as **Manager** and **AirCrew**.

---

### **Registration & guest usage rules**
- Customer email addresses must be unique.
- At least one phone number is required during registration; empty or duplicate phone entries are ignored.
- Guests can retrieve an order only by providing both the order code (`order_id`) and the associated email address.

---

### **Flight publication & lifecycle**
- Once a flight is successfully created by a manager, it is automatically published and becomes available for customer booking.
- Flight duration and landing time are calculated automatically based on the selected route and are not entered manually by the manager.
- Customers and managers view different flight boards:
  - Customers see only flights that are eligible for booking.
  - Managers can view all flights, including active, full, completed, and cancelled flights.

---

### **Flight visibility & booking eligibility**
- Customers can only view flights that meet all of the following conditions:
  - Not cancelled
  - Departure time is in the future
  - At least one seat is available
- Flights whose departure time has passed are not displayed to customers.
- Operational actions (booking, crew assignment, flight cancellation) are blocked on flights that have already departed.

---

### **Search validation (server-side)**
- Origin, destination, and departure date are mandatory search parameters.
- Origin and destination airports must be different.
- The system verifies that a valid route (`Airway`) exists between the selected origin and destination.

---

### **Seat selection & booking protection**
- Booking is blocked for cancelled flights, past/departed flights, and fully booked flights.
- Seat selection is allowed only from the pool of available seats for the chosen flight.
- Mixed-class booking is supported:
  - A single order may include seats from multiple classes (Regular and Business).
  - Pricing is calculated per seat according to its class type.

---

### **Pricing rules**
- Regular class pricing is mandatory for all flights.
- Business class pricing is available **only** for aircraft classified as **Big Planes**.

---

### **Order status & customer cancellation policy**
- Order status is derived from the flight’s departure time:
  - **Active**: paid order for a future flight
  - **Done**: paid order for a past flight
- Only paid orders can be cancelled.
- Customer cancellation is allowed only up to **36 hours** before departure.
- A fixed **5% cancellation fee** is applied to the total order amount.
- Partial cancellation of seats within an order is not allowed.
- Upon cancellation, all seats in the order are released back to availability.

---

### **Long vs. short flights**
- Flights longer than **360 minutes** are classified as *long flights*.
- Only aircraft classified as **Big Planes** may be assigned to long flights.
- Only crew members explicitly marked as long-flight qualified may be assigned to long flights.

---

### **Resource location & timeline-based availability (Aircraft & Crew)**

To reflect real-world airline scheduling, **both aircraft and crew members (pilots & attendants) are treated as being physically located at a specific airport at any point in time**.

**Key principles (per course forum clarification):**
- A resource may be assigned **only** to a flight that departs from the airport where it is located at the departure time.
- The system does **not** assume that a plane or crew member “moved” between flights, regardless of how much time passed.
- No separate calendar or manual location field is maintained for resources.  
  Instead, location is **derived dynamically from the flight timeline**.

#### **How resource location is determined**
- For a new flight with departure datetime `T` and origin airport `O`,
  the system identifies the **last non-cancelled flight** of the resource whose **landing time is ≤ T**.
- The resource’s derived location at time `T` is the destination airport of that last flight.
- **First assignment exception:**  
  If a resource has no previous flights, no location constraint is applied, and it may be assigned to a flight departing from any airport.

#### **Availability checks (time + location)**
When creating a new flight, resources shown to the manager must satisfy:
1. **Time overlap prevention:** a resource cannot be assigned to overlapping flights.
2. **Location consistency at departure:** the resource must be located at the new flight’s origin airport at departure time, unless this is its first assignment.

#### **Cancelled flights behavior**
Cancelled flights are treated as non-existent for scheduling purposes:
- Cancelled flights do not block availability.
- Cancelled flights do not affect derived resource location.
- Cancelling a flight has **no cascading effect** on future flights; the system does not attempt to repair dependent scheduling chains.

---

### **Admin flight creation validations**
- Flights cannot be created in the past (server-side enforcement).
- A valid route must exist in the `Airway` table before flight creation.
- Crew requirements depend on aircraft size:
  - **Big Plane**: 3 pilots and 6 flight attendants
  - **Small Plane**: 2 pilots and 3 flight attendants
- Seat inventory must exist for the selected aircraft before a flight can be created.

---

### **Resource creation & integrity**
- Aircraft must be registered in the system before they can be assigned to flights.
- Crew members must be registered and classified before being eligible for assignment.
- Aircraft size (Small / Big) determines:
  - Seat configuration
  - Pricing eligibility
  - Long-flight compatibility
- Crew members assigned to long flights must be explicitly marked as long-flight qualified.
- Managers are explicitly blocked from being registered as air crew members.

---

### **Flight cancellation policy (Admin)**
- Only active/open flights can be cancelled (not full, not completed, and not already cancelled).
- Flight cancellation is blocked less than **72 hours** before departure.
- Cancelling a flight triggers:
  - System cancellation of all active orders (full refund, total payment set to 0)
  - Release of all flight seats back to availability
  - Release of assigned aircraft and crew for future scheduling

---

### **Data consistency safeguards**
- Invalid `FlightSeat` records (seats that do not match the flight’s aircraft) are removed automatically.
- If `FlightSeat` records are missing for a flight, they are generated automatically from the aircraft’s seat inventory.
